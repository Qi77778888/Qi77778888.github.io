Hello! I’m Yuanzhe Zhang, a Ph.D. student of computer science at Sydney University advised by A. Prof. Jiangshan Yu (ARC DECRA Fellow), A. Prof. Lijun Chang (ARC Future Fellow), Prof.
Shirui Pan (ARC Future Fellow), and Prof. Zhiyong Wan. 
My academic interests center around blockchain scalability, sharded blockchains, decentralized finance, decentralized exchange, large-scale graph processing, convex optimization, graph partition, data mining.
I am excited about the opportunities for collaboration and advancement in my field, and am eager to continue learning and contributing to the research community. If you are willing to learn more about my research or explore potential opportunities for collaboration, I would be honored if you could kindly reach out to me. Thank you for visiting!

Publications (First-author Papers)
------
• TxAllo: Dynamic Transaction Allocation in Sharded Blockchain Systems
(CORE ranking-A*) Yuanzhe Zhang, Shirui Pan, Jiangshan Yu. IEEE ICDE 2023
- We proposed a transaction allocation scheme, TxAllo, for reducing cross-shard transactions and optimizing workload balance in sharded blockchain systems. It investigates a novel graph partition direction to cluster frequent interacted addresses into the same shard and reduces cross-shard transactions from 98% to 17%.
• Correlation-aware Next Basket Recommendation using Graph Attention Networks
(CORE ranking-A) Yuanzhe Zhang, Ling Luo, Jianjia Zhang et al. ICONIP 2020
- We developed an end-to-end model using graph attention networks to predict the next shopping basket by leveraging item correlations.
• FCP Filter: A Dynamic Clustering-Prediction Framework for Customer Behavior
(CORE ranking-A) Yuanzhe Zhang, Ling Luo, Yang Wang, Zhiyong Wang. PAKDD 2020
- We proposed FCP Filter, a Bayesian nonparametric framework for dynamic customer behavior prediction and noise filtering.
• Distributed account allocation framework and algorithm in blockchain sharding
(CORE ranking-A, under review) Submitted to IEEE ICDCS 2025
- We proposed Mosaic, a universal distributed account allocation framework to parallel run allocation algorithm. Upon Mosaic, we further propose Pilot, a lightweight distributed algorithm, to guide the allocation. The efficiency is boosted by 104, while maintaining a similar accuracy.
• Accelerate aggregated routing in decentralized exchange (Drafting)
- We investigated the leading Dex, Uniswap’s swapping routing mechanism, as well as the academic literature on the routing problem. We propose mechanisms to accelerate routing algorithm in swapping queries and develop a prediction model. This provides a new dimension of evaluation for the Dex aggregator/router/pathfinder as well as the trade-off between efficiency and optimality.
